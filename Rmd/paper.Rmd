## Results

### Linear mixed effects modeling

#### Methylation patterns with age

Globally, we find that neuronal pathways show hypermethylation with age GSEA PVAL HERE, while metabolic and immune pathways show hypomethylation with age GSEA PVAL HERE. Several promoters are outliers, showing significantly stronger associations with age than the transcriptome as a whole. For instance, the gene BSX demonstrates an exceptionally strong association with age (Fig 1b), and is representative of neuron-specific genes as a whole. In contrast, metabolic and immune-related genes frequently show hypomethylation with age



#### Methylation variation between tissues


#### Methylation variation between populations
